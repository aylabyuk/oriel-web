# Personal Info Template — AI Dialogue Source

Fill in the sections below. The 3 AI opponents (Meio, Dong, Oscar) will reference this info in their dialogue lines during gameplay, as if they're friends who know you personally.

**Guidelines:**
- Write naturally — bullet points, short phrases, or sentences are all fine
- Skip anything you're not comfortable sharing publicly
- The more specific and concrete, the better the dialogue will feel
- Sensitive info (full address, phone, exact salary, etc.) should be left out entirely
